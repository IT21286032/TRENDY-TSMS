Customers can browse all the collections of dresses on the Web and purchase them with their desired payment. They have their own delivery system also. Our system has a self-billing facility. Customers who purchase in stores can use this web app to generate bills with QR code of each dress themselves with the help of accessing web in the store. This reduces the human work force needed and saves customer’s precious time. This web app also has an inventory management system to keep the stocks of every item updated at the end of every day. The shop provides separate profiles for employees who works and delivery persons. A major challenge when purchasing dresses online is the absence of fit-on room. Our WebApp has ‘Virtual Fit-On Room’ function satisfies the customers who shop online. Moreover, it provides QR code functionalities, website pops personalized offer notifications, details about newly arrived items which ease the customer’s shopping experience. This web app not only helps customers alone, but it also helps owners and stake holders of the shop to enhance their business needs. Supplier can supply stock by accepting the bid value published by the manager.

The aim of the online clothing shop is to provide customers with high-quality clothing at affordable prices while providing excellent customer service.
